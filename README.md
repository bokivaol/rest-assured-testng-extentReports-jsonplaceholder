# Serenity JUnit Starter project


This is the simplest possible build script setup for Serenity BDD using Java. 

This is a very minimal sample project using JUnit and Serenity BDD in Java. 
You can use this project as a quick starting point for your own projects.

## Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/bokivaol/rest-assured-testng-jsonplaceholder.git
    cd serenity-junit-jsonplaceholder


Or simply [download a zip](https://github.com/bokivaol/rest-assured-testng-jsonplaceholder/archive/master.zip) file.


## Use Gradle on Windows

Open a command window and run:

    gradlew test 

## Viewing the reports

The command provided above will produce a TestNG test report in the `build/reports/testngReports` directory. Open `emailable-report.html` in Chrome and take a look!
