# Rest-Assured, TestNG and Gradle JSONPlaceholder API Test project


This is JSONPlaceholder API test project.
For the test automation I used:
- REST Assured 4.1.2
- Java 11.0.5 LTS
- TestNG 7.1.0
- Gradle 5.3.1

## Get the code

Git:

    git clone https://github.com/bokivaol/rest-assured-testng-jsonplaceholder.git
    cd rest-assured-testng-jsonplaceholder


Or simply [download a zip](https://github.com/bokivaol/rest-assured-testng-jsonplaceholder/archive/master.zip) file.


## Use Gradle on Windows

Open a command window and run:

    gradlew clean test 

## Viewing the reports

The command provided above will produce a TestNG test report in the `build/reports/testngReports` directory. Open `emailable-report.html` in Chrome and take a look!
